        <p style="text-align: left; font-size: 1.2em;"><strong>1. Sikkim</strong></p>
        
        <p style="text-align:justify; ">Sikkim, nestled in the northeastern Himalayas of India, captivated me with its pristine beauty and serene ambiance. The journey began with a scenic drive from Bagdogra to Gangtok, where the winding roads and lush landscapes set the perfect backdrop for our adventure.

            One of the highlights was visiting Tsomgo Lake, a stunning glacial lake surrounded by snow-capped peaks. The tranquility of the turquoise waters was mesmerizing. A visit to Nathula Pass, on the Indo-China border, offered breathtaking panoramic views and a sense of standing at a historic crossroad.
            
            Exploring the Rumtek Monastery was a spiritual experience, with its intricate architecture and peaceful surroundings. The aura of this revered Buddhist site was truly enchanting. In Pelling, the vistas of the Kanchenjunga range were awe-inspiring, and the sacred Khecheopalri Lake added a mystical touch to our journey.
            
            Sikkim's blend of natural splendor and rich cultural heritage left an indelible mark on me. The warmth of the locals, the serene monasteries, and the majestic mountains made this trip an unforgettable escape into a Himalayan paradise.</p>
